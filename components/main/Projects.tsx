                    A simple JavaScript based web app that helps you see the weather â›….
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It makes usage of two APIs: one to fetch the country code and another for the weather informations.
                    It displays a solid use of JavaScript and the DOM but also a good understanding of network requests and
                    asynchronous programming.
                    <br />
                    During this project I&apos;ve learned how to use APIs and how to handle the data they send back. I&apos;ve also
                    learned how to use the DOM to display the data in a user-friendly way.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I&apos;ve struggledðŸ˜… a bit to find a good way to display the weather data and managing the restrictions for the search bar.
                    But I&apos;ve managed to do it and I&apos;m really proud of the result. It&apos;s a really simple app but I think it really makes a
                    solid use of the basic technologies.

                    Modest website for selling products coded mainly using Express and Handlebars. It&apos;s really simple ðŸ˜„.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This project really helped me using express to handle routes. Through it I&apos;ve also discovered the usage
                    of the view engine Handlebars. I&apos;ve used a middleware to make the site only available between 9 AM and 5 PM.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Through this project I&apos;ve learned how to use Express to handle routes and how to use Handlebars to display
                    the data. It really gave me a good understanding of routes definition and middlewares. I&apos;m also really proud of
                    the design of the website.

                <Project title="C++ Task Manager" src="/projects/videos/cpp.mp4" github="https://github.com/Josh012006/Tasks-Manager" poster="/projects/g2.webp">
                    Simple tasks manager wrote in C++. I haven&apos;t done the GUI yet so it runs in the terminal.
                    But I plan to do it with Qt.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I implemented a task manager that can help you keep your tasks, delete some and even see
                    the saved tasks. The tasks are saved in a file so that they don&apos;t disappear after the user
                    closes the program.
                    It is fully implemented in C++. I made it so that the code is really easy to understand for
                    someone with some knowledge of C++ and STL. For the time being it only works in the Terminal.
                    But there will be an app version done with Qt in the near future.

                <Project title="CMS Website" src="/projects/videos/cms.mp4" github="https://github.com/Josh012006/CMS" poster="/projects/g3.webp">
                    A simple CMS app where users can post content and view others&apos; posts. Built with TypeScript and Vite. I&apos;ve used MongoDB as the database.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    On this site you can make posts and like others&apos; posts. This project really helped me dive deeper into TypeScript and MongoDB. With the use of
                    Mongoose, I was able to define user, post and media models and controllers. It was my first time really dealing with the storage of images in a database.
                    So it also helped me touch multer. I&apos;ve also used the FilePond library that is perfect for files uploading.

                    Le CafÃ© du Coin is a demonstration website for a cafÃ©, built with React via create-react-app. This project showcases the key features of a modern showcase 
                    site, offering an intuitive, responsive user interface.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The used technologies are React and TailwindCSS. This project demonstrates my ability to create modern, attractive web applications, essential for any commercial 
                    or showcase site development.

                    An appointment app made with Next.js and TailwindCSS. It&apos;s the greatest project I&apos;ve worked on till now.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This web app is fully made with Next.js. I&apos;ve used Mongoose to connect to my MongoDB database and to define appointments and users&apos; schemas.
                    I&apos;ve used TailwindCSS for the style. On the app, as a patient you can requests appointments and keep track of the responses. As a secretary, you can see the requests and give an answer that is an appointment.
                    The doctor just has to see the appointments and the patients&apos; informations.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The part where I struggled the most is the management of the security and the restrictions on the app. It was really challenging to imagine all the cases and the possibilities to try to avoid disorder and attacks.
