## My portfolio
So hello. This is a better version of my old portfolio (https://github.com/Josh012006/Next-JS).
This one is also built in Next.js. It has every part of a standard Web Dev Portfolio. I also added a theme changer using redux toolkit.

## How to use it
If it seems interesting to you, you can just clone it.
Don't forget to run
**npm i**
You must also give in the .env
EMAIL_PASSWORD= 
for the contact part, the route to send mail.

You can run the project with **npm run dev** and modify it as you see fit.

## Deployment
I've hosted the website on vercel: https://josue-mongan.vercel.app/

## Hope you enjoy
If you enjoyed please don't forget to leave a star. You can also connect with me if you want to discuss or if you have any need about the project.
Contributions are also welcome. 
Have fun!
